1
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:31,677
Hey!

2
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,943
"We live in a twilight world..."

3
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,655
"We live in a twilight world..."

4
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:23,653
"... and there are no friends at dusk."

5
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,744
You've been made. This siege
is a blind for them to vanish you.

6
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,671
But I established contact.

7
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,048
Bring you in or kill you.

8
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,630
You have two minutes.
Make up your mind.

9
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:43,757
Where's the package?

10
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:45,095
Coat check.

11
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:10,669
Stay.

12
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,716
No friends at dusk, huh?

13
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,570
You'll do.

14
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,151
Get him to the rally point.

15
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,016
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

16
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,976
I've never seen encapsulation like this.

17
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,236
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

18
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:21,406
Did you have an out?

19
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,859
Service tunnel to the sewer.

20
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,614
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

21
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,618
Can you defuse that?

22
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,509
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

23
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:30,412
Covering their tracks.

24
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,228
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

25
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,562
That's not our mission.

26
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:34,666
Mine now.

27
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:01,154
Walk away.

28
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,109
You don't have to kill these people.

29
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,966
That wasn't one of us.

30
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,499
I'll take the help.

31
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:25,637
Go, go, go.

32
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:59,661
A man can be trained
to hold out for about 18 hours,

33
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,797
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

34
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:10,838
He didn't last 18 minutes.

35
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,761
He didn't have anything to hide.

36
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:15,222
You were smuggling a nobody.

37
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:19,935
It's risky.

38
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,520
Or were you counting on this?

39
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:26,904
Death.

40
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,986
CIA issue.

41
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,375
Spare yourself, once they clear.

42
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,508
Almost 7:00.

43
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,143
Uh-oh.

44
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:03,933
It's running fast.

45
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,197
We have to put it back one hour.

46
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,172
Get it out!

47
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,245
Welcome to the afterlife.

48
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:00,201
You've been in a medically-induced coma

49
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:03,914
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

50
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:08,127
The suicide pills are fake.

51
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,295
Why?

52
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,585
A test.

53
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:13,256
A test?

54
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,466
They pulled my teeth out.

55
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,228
Did my team get clear?

56
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,264
No.

57
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,561
Private russians, we think.

58
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,481
Somebody talked.

59
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,646
Not you.

60
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:35,195
You chose to die
instead of giving up your colleagues.

61
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:47,086
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

62
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:52,296
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

63
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,676
You do.

64
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,509
I resign.

65
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:04,053
You don't work for us. You're dead.

66
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:08,103
Your duty transcends national interests.

67
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,017
This is about survival.

68
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:13,521
Whose?

69
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,450
Everyone's.

70
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,155
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

71
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,909
To even know its true nature is to lose.

72
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,544
This is knowledge divided.

73
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:32,332
All I have for you is a gesture

74
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,671
in combination with a word.

75
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:35,961
"Tenet."

76
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,092
Use it carefully.

77
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,889
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

78
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,974
That's all they've told you?

79
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,689
That test you passed?

80
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,601
Not everybody does.

81
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:09,156
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

82
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,948
Almost.

83
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,083
An obscure tenet.

84
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:22,843
No small talk.

85
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,130
Nothing that might reveal who we are
or what we do.

86
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,844
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

87
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,093
You're not here for "what",
you're here for "how".

88
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,389
"What" is your department
and not my business.

89
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,182
Well, to do what I do...

90
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,230
... I need some idea of the threat we face.

91
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:45,525
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War III.

92
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:47,364
Nuclear holocaust?

93
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:48,948
No.

94
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,035
Something worse.

95
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:02,625
Aim it and pull the trigger.

96
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:05,722
It's empty.

97
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,890
Aim it.

98
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:13,932
Check the magazine.

99
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,525
How?

100
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:28,864
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

101
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,741
The other one's going backwards.

102
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,415
Can you tell which is which?

103
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:37,785
How about now?

104
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:41,004
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

105
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:44,167
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

106
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:47,462
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

107
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
You didn't make it?

108
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,972
No, we don't know how yet.

109
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,473
So, where'd it come from?

110
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:53,760
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

111
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,849
They're streaming back at us.

112
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,183
Try it.

113
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,188
You have to have dropped it.

114
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,165
How can it move before I touch it?

115
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,751
From your point of view, you caught it.

116
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:25,086
But from the bullet's point of view,
you dropped it.

117
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,001
But cause comes before effect.

118
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,545
No, that's just the way we see time.

119
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,881
Well, what about free will?

120
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,659
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

121
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:37,595
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

122
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,605
Don't try to understand it.

123
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:43,108
Feel it.

124
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:54,737
Instinct.

125
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,615
Got it.

126
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:04,456
Why does it feel so strange?

127
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,795
You're not shooting the bullet,

128
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,335
you're catching it.

129
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:12,551
Whoa.

130
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,092
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

131
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,271
In the field?

132
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:19,515
I was almost hit.

133
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,351
Then you were exceedingly lucky.

134
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:24,935
An inverted bullet passing
through your body would be devastating.

135
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:26,318
Not pretty.

136
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,112
These look like today's.

137
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:31,564
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

138
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
Where did you get them?

139
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,613
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

140
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,326
Do you have an analysis on the metals?

141
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,241
Sure. Why?

142
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,898
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

143
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,287
Look...

144
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,297
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

145
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,503
The bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.

146
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:55,514
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

147
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:57,435
If they can invert that,

148
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,806
I see no reason they couldn't invert
pretty much anything.

149
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,017
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

150
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:06,730
An inverted weapon might be able
to affect our past as well.

151
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,321
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

152
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:17,782
Remnants of complex objects.

153
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,575
What do you think we're seeing?

154
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:27,038
The detritus of a coming war.

155
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,213
- Yep?
- We live in a twilight world.

156
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,478
No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.

157
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,021
Even the dead need allies.

158
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,359
Specifically?

159
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,909
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

160
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,079
Singh?

161
00:17:58,163 --> 00:17:59,963
He never leaves his house.
And his house is...

162
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,541
- His house.
- Yes, it is.

163
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,119
I'm looking right at it.

164
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,909
I'll see who's on deck.

165
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,078
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

166
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:20,755
It seems you need an introduction

167
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,974
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

168
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:26,232
I'm Neil.

169
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,391
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

170
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:31,856
That's not possible.

171
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,363
Ten minutes tops.

172
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,649
Time isn't the problem.

173
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:39,777
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

174
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,999
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

175
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,330
If I had to.

176
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,104
I'm not looking to make much noise here.

177
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:50,462
Yes?

178
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,500
Vodka tonic. And a diet coke.

179
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:56,968
What?

180
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,137
You never drink on the job.

181
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,760
You're well informed.

182
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,472
Well, pays to be in our profession.

183
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,558
Well, I prefer soda water.

184
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,426
No, you don't.

185
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,393
How's your parachuting?

186
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:15,403
I broke an ankle during basic training.

187
00:19:15,574 --> 00:19:18,361
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

188
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:19,866
It's bungee-jumpable.

189
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:22,528
I don't think "bungee-jumpable”
is a word.

190
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,493
It may not be a word, but it may be
our only way out of that place.

191
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:28,708
Or into it, for that matter.

192
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,917
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

193
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:14,940
Stay back.

194
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,443
I was almost taken out by a very unusual
type of ammunition in Ukraine.

195
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:21,481
I want to know who supplied it.

196
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,273
My name is Sanjay.

197
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:24,567
And you are?

198
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:27,448
No chitchat?

199
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,869
There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you, anyway.

200
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,372
Don't let it get cold.

201
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,376
Why should I know who supplied it?

202
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,462
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

203
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:42,781
If it's from India, it's from you.

204
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,466
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

205
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,050
Deduction, then.

206
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,806
Look, my friend...

207
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:50,843
Guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

208
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,512
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

209
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,258
Or the man they send to make deals.

210
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,772
But I am the man people talk to.

211
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:02,821
I can't.

212
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:04,196
I can't tell you.

213
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,428
You're an arms dealer, friend.

214
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:07,818
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

215
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:10,453
To say anything about a client

216
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:12,831
would violate the tenets he lives by.

217
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,668
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

218
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:18,548
Everything.

219
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,048
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

220
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:25,173
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

221
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:26,806
Cheers.

222
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,097
Priya. Hmm.

223
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,175
This is your operation?

224
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,807
A masculine front in a man's world
has its uses.

225
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,893
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

226
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,432
The russian oligarch.

227
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,225
- You know him?
- Not personally.

228
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:42,736
Made his billions in gas.

229
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:46,194
Moved to London.
Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

230
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,029
Very good.

231
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:50,785
Except the gas he made his billions from
was actually plutonium.

232
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:55,165
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

233
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,667
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

234
00:22:57,838 --> 00:22:59,294
So how did he get them inverted?

235
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:03,089
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

236
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,251
Between our time and the future.

237
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,378
He can communicate with the future?

238
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:10,047
We all do, don't we?

239
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:12,136
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

240
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:15,223
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

241
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:19,481
The question is,
can the future speak back?

242
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,683
And I'm supposed to find out?

243
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:25,942
To get anywhere near Sator
would take a fresh-faced protagonist.

244
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:28,949
And you are fresh as a Daisy.

245
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,411
Get close.

246
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,945
Find out what he's receiving and how.

247
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:34,988
Is it safe to involve
british intelligence?

248
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,704
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

249
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,798
You must've had a plan for getting out.

250
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,506
Not one I love.

251
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:13,068
May I help you, sir?

252
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:14,862
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

253
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,782
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

254
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,040
Presume away.

255
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:20,667
If you'll follow me.

256
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:27,591
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

257
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:29,593
I'll catch up.

258
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:31,677
Same for me, please.

259
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:33,034
I'll send the waiter.

260
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:34,673
No, just pass on the order.

261
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:38,351
I gather you have an interest
in a certain russian national.

262
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:41,138
Anglo-russian.
So I have to watch my step.

263
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,141
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

264
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,651
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

265
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:48,729
But they don't seem to care.

266
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:49,987
Tell me about him.

267
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:53,650
I assume you're familiar
with the soviet-era secret cities...

268
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:58,242
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

269
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:01,500
Most of them have been opened up
and renamed as regular towns.

270
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,331
Not the one Sator grew up in.

271
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:04,585
Stalsk-12.

272
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,923
In the 70s, it had a population
of about 200,000.

273
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:09,128
Thought to be abandoned.

274
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:10,174
Abandoned?

275
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:14,714
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

276
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:17,473
Two weeks ago,
same day as the Kiev opera siege,

277
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,681
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

278
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,892
just where Stalsk-12 was.

279
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:26,521
Sator emerged
from this blank spot on the map

280
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,693
with ambition...

281
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:31,731
And enough money to buy his way
into the british establishment.

282
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:32,738
Through his wife?

283
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:35,946
Katherine Barton.
Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.

284
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:38,282
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

285
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:39,457
A happy marriage?

286
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:40,955
Practically estranged.

287
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,830
Well, how do I get to Sator?

288
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,250
Well, through her, of course.

289
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,912
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

290
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,591
Hardly.

291
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,667
We have an ace in the hole.

292
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,968
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag.

293
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:59,098
It's a fake by a spaniard named Arepo.

294
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,807
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

295
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,430
What happened to the other one?

296
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:07,478
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

297
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:08,652
Put on auction.

298
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,644
And who do you think bought it?

299
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:11,822
Her husband?

300
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:12,942
Mmm-hmm.

301
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,157
Does she know it's a forgery?

302
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,534
Oh, it's hard to say.

303
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:21,572
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

304
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,865
Uh-huh.

305
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:26,084
Look, no offense,

306
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:29,667
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

307
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,375
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

308
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,089
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

309
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:37,675
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

310
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:40,139
Can I recommend a tailor?

311
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,425
I'll manage.

312
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,844
You british don't have a monopoly
on snobbery, you know.

313
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:45,262
Well, not a monopoly.

314
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,396
More of a controlling interest.

315
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,355
Could you box that up for me?

316
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:51,529
Certainly not.

317
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,737
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

318
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:28,813
How can I help, sir?

319
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:35,149
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

320
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,323
Goya.

321
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:38,486
Mr. Goya.

322
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:41,284
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

323
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,284
That's extraordinary.

324
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:51,870
What's it worth?

325
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:54,790
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

326
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:59,048
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

327
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,262
Provenance, microscopic examination,
x-rays.

328
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,518
But what does your heart tell you?

329
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:12,695
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

330
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:14,692
Tomás Arepo.

331
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:21,700
I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar
from an irate swiss banker.

332
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,657
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

333
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:27,538
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

334
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,870
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

335
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:31,272
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

336
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,877
My drawing's a very good fake.

337
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:34,458
You know that better than anyone.

338
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:35,873
The information's the bargain.

339
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:40,089
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

340
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:43,255
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

341
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,869
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

342
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,178
Arrangement?

343
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,684
You mean blackmail.

344
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:49,139
Don't be afraid of the word.

345
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:51,305
My husband isn't.

346
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:53,144
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

347
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:55,198
He knows?
And he's never done anything about it?

348
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:56,442
Why would he?

349
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,103
He paid $9 million for it.

350
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,562
Barely cover the cost of the holiday
he just forced us on.

351
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,115
Where'd you go, Mars?

352
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,115
Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht.

353
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,823
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

354
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,352
Think you're a little out of your depth.

355
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:16,668
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

356
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:20,425
generally aren't okay with being
cheated out of any of it.

357
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,266
The drawing is his hold over me.

358
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,434
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

359
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,479
He controls me.

360
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:44,400
My contact with my son. Everything.

361
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:47,785
Leaving would never have been easy,
but now it's impossible.

362
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,073
You can't fight.

363
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:53,742
Just beg.

364
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,621
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.

365
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:01,421
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

366
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:05,678
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

367
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,097
imitating some earlier time
in our lives.

368
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,429
He seemed happy, so I asked him.

369
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,269
And he made me an offer.

370
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,022
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

371
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,987
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.

372
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,149
He called us, contrite.

373
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,025
And when we got back,

374
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:28,931
I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,

375
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,365
and he'd vanished.

376
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,287
I never felt such envy.

377
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:36,747
You don't seem the jealous type.

378
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:38,411
Of her freedom.

379
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:44,794
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

380
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,256
But you share a son.

381
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,838
That's my life now.

382
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,512
Did you know the drawing was a fake?

383
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:52,603
No.

384
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:55,136
Tomás and I became close,
maybe too close.

385
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:56,315
I failed.

386
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:59,099
Andrei can't conceive of failure,
only betrayal.

387
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,938
But I didn't betray my husband.

388
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:03,524
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.

389
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,359
And he let Arepo walk free.

390
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,489
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

391
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,151
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

392
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,445
We spoke on the phone.

393
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:13,284
He can't do that either.

394
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,703
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

395
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,367
Get me an introduction.

396
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:19,251
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

397
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,663
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

398
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,673
I might just be your second chance.

399
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:26,584
No, I don't need redemption.

400
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,094
At betrayal.

401
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,227
Friends of your husband's?

402
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,849
You knew this was going to happen?

403
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:40,231
Don't worry, they won't kill you.

404
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:43,394
Andrei dislikes tangling with
local law enforcement on that level.

405
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,687
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

406
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:46,900
The look of you's fine.

407
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:50,363
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

408
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,765
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

409
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,074
Don't call from home.

410
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,407
You won't be taking my call.

411
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:01,210
I might surprise you.

412
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,111
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

413
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,532
Can we get going?

414
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:53,387
Please?

415
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,340
He wants you to see.

416
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,710
And he gets what he wants.

417
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:32,252
Not always, apparently.

418
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:40,081
Anna says we're going to Pompeii

419
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,018
and see lava.

420
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:43,521
We will. We'll go together.

421
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,306
I'll be there, too!

422
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,627
Told you I'd surprise you.

423
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,341
He's a cute kid.

424
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,551
He's everything.

425
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,627
Where's the drawing?

426
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,421
Oslo. At the airport.

427
00:34:16,808 --> 00:34:17,808
The airport?

428
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:19,758
Do you know what a freeport is?

429
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,290
A storage facility for art
that was acquired...

430
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:24,599
But not yet taxed.

431
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:27,265
We started a network

432
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:31,190
Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.

433
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,229
The facilities are tax havens.

434
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:35,970
The clients can view their
investments without importing them,

435
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:37,985
so they avoid paying tax.

436
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,779
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

437
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:42,072
Art, antiquities.

438
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,370
- Anything of value, really.
- Anything?

439
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:46,117
Anything legal.

440
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:48,056
But it's not unlike the swiss
banking system.

441
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:49,545
Opaque.

442
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:54,800
As I'm sure you are aware,
most freeports are just warehouses.

443
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:57,633
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

444
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:00,160
Rotas has assets in the Oslo freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

445
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,175
And this way to the vaults!

446
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,093
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

447
00:35:04,272 --> 00:35:06,433
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

448
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,206
To view art?
And whatever it is he does.

449
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:11,226
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

450
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,149
But the freeports are.

451
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:16,940
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

452
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:19,825
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

453
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:22,658
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

454
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:38,341
Some of our clients opt
for biometric access, straight in...

455
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:41,305
Off the tarmac.

456
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,556
From the terminal?

457
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:45,468
From their private planes.

458
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:46,682
Of course.

459
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:50,431
Our logistics department
ships to and from

460
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:51,754
any other freeport in the world

461
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:53,314
without customs inspection.

462
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,625
What are you hoping
to find in there?

463
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:56,862
You really wanna know?

464
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,735
I'm not sure.

465
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,821
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

466
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,204
Jesus.

467
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:03,949
It's nuclear.

468
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:06,114
When you're on the tour,

469
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,248
pay attention to the fire precautions.

470
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,023
Documents are vulnerable to...

471
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,378
Fire? Absolutely!

472
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,902
No, I was going to say water damage
from the sprinkler systems.

473
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:16,962
We don't use sprinklers.

474
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:19,752
The facility is flooded with halide gas,

475
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,887
displacing all the air within seconds.

476
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:24,226
Can you show me?

477
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:26,476
If I did, we'd suffocate.

478
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:28,849
What about the staff?

479
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,559
Halide only fills the vaults,

480
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,390
they just have to get
into either corridor,

481
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,438
and there is a ten-second warning.

482
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,148
At least you give them ten seconds.

483
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,279
Well, sir, our clients use us
because we have no priorities

484
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:42,737
above their property.

485
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:43,951
Blimey.

486
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,528
All doors are fireproof.

487
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:48,449
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

488
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,332
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

489
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:51,788
Why a lockdown?

490
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:54,705
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

491
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,464
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

492
00:36:58,553 --> 00:36:59,713
And pickable locks.

493
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:01,156
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

494
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Child's play?

495
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:03,633
They're inside airport security.

496
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:06,720
They have to worry about
climate control, not armed raids.

497
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,556
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

498
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,312
to trigger the lockdown procedure?

499
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,645
Back wall of the freeport.

500
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:15,934
You've got something?

501
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:18,353
Not gonna like it.

502
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:20,988
You wanna crash a plane?

503
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,400
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

504
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,194
I want to run a jet off the taxiway

505
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:28,575
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

506
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,082
Well, how big a plane?

507
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:36,671
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

508
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:39,583
This is Mahir.

509
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:40,841
His team'll work the plane.

510
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,085
There can't be passengers.

511
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:43,799
NORSKFREIGHT.

512
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,214
They use the hangar
on the West Side of the freeport.

513
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:48,632
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

514
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,264
We pop the slides, Chuck 'em off.

515
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:51,678
On the move?

516
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,346
What's the problem? They'll be fine.

517
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:56,103
Well, it seems bold.

518
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:59,019
Bold I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say nuts.

519
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,257
And if you get caught?

520
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:01,281
We won't.

521
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:02,609
And if you do?

522
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,528
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

523
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,532
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

524
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,446
It'll barely make the news.

525
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,873
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

526
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:15,251
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

527
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:16,536
Gold bars?

528
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:18,796
NORSKFREIGHT ships treasury gold
once a month.

529
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,332
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

530
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:25,879
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

531
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,163
The space in the center
of the Pentagon is too big.

532
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,427
There's something there.

533
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,388
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

534
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,607
That's 45 seconds.

535
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:39,858
Ample.

536
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:41,152
Won't you be running?

537
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:44,301
All right, it's your turn.

538
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,690
Start packing.

539
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,863
Gentlemen, if you would,
through the detector, please.

540
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,850
Sir?

541
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,174
Oh.

542
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,602
And, sir.

543
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:23,648
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

544
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:25,423
No, I'll take an espresso.

545
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,152
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

546
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,862
Excellent.

547
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,679
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

548
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,830
Because all I got here is vegetarian.

549
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,251
So that looks like meat,

550
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:48,991
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

551
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:51,176
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

552
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,018
Okay.

553
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,519
This way, gentlemen.

554
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,704
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

555
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,592
Carry on. Not the radio.

556
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,604
Let's go.

557
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,413
Uh...

558
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,013
Yoga.

559
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:18,968
Let's go! Now!

560
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:50,552
Go, go, go!

561
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,249
Right. Um...

562
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,526
You said ten seconds, right?

563
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:07,516
There's someone in here with us.

564
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:23,907
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

565
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,234
Don't touch them!

566
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:55,438
The hell happened here?

567
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,816
It hasn't happened yet.

568
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:23,252
Don't kill him!

569
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,377
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

570
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,548
Why are you here?

571
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:32,432
Who are you?

572
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,227
How'd you know we'd be here?

573
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:51,944
We need to go.

574
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,118
What happened to the other guy?

575
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,837
Took care of him.

576
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,000
Well, I've seen too much.

577
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,644
I'm still alive, which must mean
you've decided to trust me.

578
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:22,524
Or maybe I lost my edge.

579
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,275
Edge is still intact.

580
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,980
There's a cold war.

581
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:29,492
Nuclear?

582
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,067
Temporal.

583
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,454
Time travel?

584
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,539
No.

585
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,782
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

586
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,500
You mean reverse chronology.

587
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:43,149
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

588
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,253
moving backwards in time?

589
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:46,086
Sure, that's exactly what I meant.

590
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,670
I have a master's in physics.

591
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:49,176
Well, try and keep up.

592
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,802
The implications of this are...

593
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:51,973
Beyond secret.

594
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,179
Then why'd you bring me in?

595
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:56,141
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

596
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:57,926
Not as surprised as I was.

597
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,972
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

598
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:05,147
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

599
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,733
It's all about plutonium.

600
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,385
And when we're done, they'll kill you.

601
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:12,650
Won't you have to do that anyway?

602
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,943
I'd rather it be my decision.

603
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,122
So would I.

604
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:17,832
I think.

605
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:30,970
Your work?

606
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,103
What did you find in the vaults?

607
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,262
Two antagonists. One inverted.

608
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:42,146
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

609
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,647
Both emerged at the same moment?

610
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:44,817
Yeah.

611
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:46,642
They were the same person.

612
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,069
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.

613
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,446
Turnstile?

614
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,029
A machine for inverting.

615
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:56,819
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

616
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:57,997
It hasn't.

617
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,360
He's been given it by the future.

618
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,910
For what?

619
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,121
You have the best chance of finding out.

620
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,524
- Have you met him?
- I was close.

621
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:08,880
What if you have something he needs?

622
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:10,416
Such as?

623
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:12,710
Plutonium-241.

624
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:15,925
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241
from under a CIA team

625
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,465
at the opera siege in Kiev.

626
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,009
He got the team.

627
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:21,222
Not the 241.

628
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,226
Who did?

629
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,558
Ukrainian security services.

630
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,019
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

631
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,936
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

632
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,104
is unacceptable, Priya.

633
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,068
I'm just gonna take him out.

634
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,484
No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive.

635
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:39,278
He has to stay alive
until we know his part in things.

636
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:40,866
Leverage the situation,

637
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,032
without losing control of the 241.

638
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,666
It's too dangerous.

639
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:47,122
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

640
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,913
is nothing compared with
what will happen if we don't stop Sator.

641
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:51,673
From doing what?

642
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:55,461
We are being attacked by the future.

643
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,765
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

644
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:18,070
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

645
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,906
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

646
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,695
You destroyed it?

647
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:24,077
I didn't think you'd want it back.

648
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,251
Does he know?

649
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:26,787
Not yet. So sit tight.

650
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:27,997
Sit tight?

651
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,900
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

652
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,004
It won't be long.

653
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,671
In the meantime, introduce me.

654
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:36,304
As what?

655
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:39,050
I'm a former first secretary
from the american embassy in Riyadh.

656
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,972
We met at a party last June.

657
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:42,870
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

658
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:45,226
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

659
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:48,059
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

660
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,939
Sator left early. That's when we met.

661
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,520
I came into Shipley's in London.

662
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,185
You ran into me here

663
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:54,944
and wanna show me your yacht.

664
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,821
He'll think we're having an affair.

665
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,409
Then he'll wanna meet me.

666
00:51:58,577 --> 00:51:59,577
Or have you killed.

667
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:01,819
Let me worry about that.

668
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:03,612
Did I look worried?

669
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,574
Sleeps 70 with crew.

670
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:09,243
Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

671
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,752
Afraid of pirates?

672
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:13,413
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

673
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:15,072
The day they turn, that's his refuge.

674
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:16,385
May I join you?

675
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,135
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers
just now.

676
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:20,967
Then we'll take mine.

677
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:55,925
Max!

678
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,627
Who's the american?

679
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,014
He's a friend.

680
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:04,343
The man from Shipley's.

681
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,676
Who you tried to have beaten up.

682
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,180
I ask again, who is he?

683
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,393
We met in Riyadh last June
at the american embassy.

684
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,983
Good with fists for a diplomat.

685
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,148
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.

686
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,443
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

687
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:25,781
Max?

688
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:28,823
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

689
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,282
You just sent him off?

690
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,080
I promised him I'd go with him.

691
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,538
I explained you were busy.

692
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:39,420
With your friend.

693
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,030
Hey, easy, fella.

694
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:04,824
Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.

695
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,834
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

696
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:21,709
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

697
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,965
Uh... no.

698
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:25,973
Not yet.

699
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,090
How would you like to die?

700
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:30,811
Old.

701
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,391
You chose the wrong profession.

702
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,106
There's a walled garden up the road.

703
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,518
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

704
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,608
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.

705
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,649
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

706
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:47,283
block the windpipe.

707
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:48,871
Complex.

708
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:51,822
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

709
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,834
try to pull his own balls
out of his throat before he chokes.

710
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,524
Is this how you treat all your guests?

711
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,087
We're finished.

712
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:04,136
Do you like opera?

713
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,099
Well?

714
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,476
Not here.

715
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:17,813
You sail?

716
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:19,190
I've messed around on boats.

717
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,273
Be on the dock at 8:00
ready to do more than mess around.

718
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:23,823
8:00 am.

719
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,704
Max has missed
too much school this year.

720
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:42,109
I'm taking him back to England.

721
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,903
The school won't be okay
with him missing so much of the term.

722
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:45,633
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

723
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,758
You have all the trappings of a king.

724
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,298
We both know you're a grubby little man
playing power games

725
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,262
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

726
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,931
You seem...

727
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:58,851
Spirited today.

728
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,893
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

729
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,526
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

730
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:14,663
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

731
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,371
I've always had instincts
about the future.

732
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,167
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

733
00:56:38,356 --> 00:56:40,017
Sailing or diving?

734
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,573
Rising!

735
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,441
What do you know about opera?

736
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,899
In 2008,
a remote Russian missile station

737
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:31,156
was overwhelmed and held for a week.

738
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:33,566
When the station was retaken,

739
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:37,408
241 on one warhead
was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

740
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,494
The missing 241

741
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:46,584
surfaced at the opera house siege
in Kiev on the 14th.

742
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:48,498
Coming about!

743
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,776
What do you propose?

744
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:10,739
Partnership.

745
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,780
I wouldn't partner with you.

746
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:15,943
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

747
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:19,324
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

748
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,997
who knows how to cover his tracks.

749
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,247
Not that shocking.

750
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,660
For an intelligence agent.

751
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:26,624
Right!

752
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:30,749
Burn in hell, Andrei.

753
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:40,015
You can't jibe a boat like this!

754
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,426
You can if you have to.

755
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,039
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

756
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:12,297
I need him.

757
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:13,962
What, to sell guns?

758
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,217
I'm not who you think I am.

759
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:16,385
Well, that I know.

760
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:18,217
He showed me the drawing.

761
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,679
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.

762
00:59:21,853 --> 00:59:23,733
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

763
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:26,304
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

764
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:27,483
He's so much more.

765
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,068
What, then?

766
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,732
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives
in his hands, not just yours.

767
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,575
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

768
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:43,749
Okay.

769
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,292
Now.

770
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,410
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?

771
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,217
- Trust me.
- Save it.

772
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:58,469
I'm not falling for it twice.

773
01:00:00,725 --> 01:00:02,056
You have a better option?

774
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:06,928
Whatever it takes to get what you want.

775
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:09,598
Not a second's thought for me or my son.

776
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,355
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

777
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,371
Try not to use it.

778
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,042
On anyone.

779
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,753
Enough.

780
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:46,305
See? Pulse of a man half my age.

781
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,181
Drink with me.

782
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:55,022
It seems I now owe you my life.

783
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:56,613
It's nothing.

784
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,362
My life is not nothing.

785
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:01,149
And I don't like to be in debt.

786
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:03,322
Then pay me.

787
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:05,532
No retribution against your wife.

788
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:11,159
You think she released my harness?

789
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:16,418
It was my own mistake.

790
01:01:17,093 --> 01:01:19,004
Then help me steal the 241.

791
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,420
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

792
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:23,492
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

793
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:24,926
I know what it means.

794
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,262
You lecture me about radiation?

795
01:01:31,274 --> 01:01:33,185
Andrei Sator,

796
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,898
digging plutonium from the rubble
of my city as a teenager.

797
01:01:38,072 --> 01:01:39,072
Where?

798
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,612
Stalsk-12.

799
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,121
My home.

800
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:53,456
One part of a warhead exploded
at ground level, scattering the others.

801
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:57,553
They needed people to find the plutonium.

802
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,634
It became my first contract.

803
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:05,092
Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.

804
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:09,144
But...

805
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:13,729
... one man's probability of death...

806
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:19,816
... is another man's possibility
for a life.

807
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:24,733
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

808
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:29,704
Even now, my company
is the only one to operate in the ruins.

809
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:33,700
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

810
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:37,962
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

811
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:41,458
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

812
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:48,510
Stay with us tonight.

813
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:50,300
I insist.

814
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:18,835
What do you want?

815
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,043
We're going to talk about today.

816
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,010
No, we're not.

817
01:03:23,177 --> 01:03:24,177
No?

818
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,215
We'll see.

819
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:29,365
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

820
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:31,223
like you treat your other women.

821
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:35,224
And, uh...

822
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,307
How do you imagine...

823
01:03:39,277 --> 01:03:40,733
I treat these other women, huh?

824
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:43,360
You think I force them
into conversation?

825
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:44,896
You wanna be quiet, fine.

826
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:46,689
You can bite down on that.

827
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:53,242
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

828
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,828
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?

829
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:58,243
That's all I have to offer you.

830
01:03:58,379 --> 01:03:59,869
Well, that will have to do, then.

831
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:02,664
Why didn't you just let me go?

832
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,833
Because...

833
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:11,465
If I can't have you...

834
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,552
No one else can.

835
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:19,681
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

836
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:21,648
You think I let him interfere?

837
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:24,310
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.

838
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:25,524
End of deal.

839
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,482
So you leave me alone.

840
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,902
Not now!

841
01:06:52,887 --> 01:06:56,971
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.

842
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:09,688
He was at the window.

843
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:12,695
I was curious.

844
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:16,942
My property shouldn't concern you.

845
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,700
Who are you?

846
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:20,953
How do you come by
your information about the opera?

847
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:25,366
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

848
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:28,833
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

849
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:31,377
They're usually buying, not selling.

850
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,876
But we do live in a twilight world.

851
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:36,844
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

852
01:07:37,014 --> 01:07:38,720
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.

853
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:42,387
No balls in my throat?

854
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:46,058
There will be no time for such things...

855
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:47,232
In Tallinn.

856
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:51,560
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

857
01:07:51,737 --> 01:07:52,772
No.

858
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:59,525
I spring the material. You pay me off.

859
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:01,285
Your wife does the exchange.

860
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:02,849
I never involve her in my business.

861
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:04,363
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

862
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:06,491
Put him ashore.

863
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:08,313
How do I contact you?

864
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:09,167
You don't.

865
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:10,999
How do you advance me the funds?

866
01:08:14,885 --> 01:08:17,877
Handle the plutonium better than that.

867
01:08:28,065 --> 01:08:29,209
What did you find on the gold?

868
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:31,224
No franks, no mold marks.
Nothing.

869
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:33,358
- How?
- Dead drops.

870
01:08:33,904 --> 01:08:36,862
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

871
01:08:37,074 --> 01:08:40,066
then digs it up to collect
the inverted materials they sent.

872
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,453
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

873
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:46,535
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

874
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:48,449
What did the soil samples show?

875
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:51,001
Northern Europe, Asia.

876
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:52,332
Radioactive.

877
01:08:52,506 --> 01:08:55,373
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

878
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,260
Why am I here?

879
01:08:57,386 --> 01:09:00,594
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

880
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,870
Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?

881
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,802
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

882
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,061
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

883
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:10,846
They have a point.

884
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,045
Is the convoy monitored from the air?

885
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:16,732
Tracked by GPS.
One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.

886
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:18,187
We need big guns.

887
01:09:18,282 --> 01:09:20,568
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

888
01:09:20,743 --> 01:09:23,860
We need a fast car that
doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

889
01:09:24,038 --> 01:09:25,244
All different.

890
01:09:25,414 --> 01:09:28,281
Bus, coach, 18-Wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

891
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:32,118
Most of all, we have to set this up
with nothing in the record.

892
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:34,203
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

893
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:38,500
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

894
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:41,294
His ignorance is our only protection.

895
01:10:18,884 --> 01:10:20,124
You see, Kat?

896
01:10:21,095 --> 01:10:23,336
Some of my favorites.

897
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:29,725
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

898
01:10:29,895 --> 01:10:32,386
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

899
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:36,023
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

900
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:39,318
But this is where our worlds collide.

901
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:41,069
What is this, Andrei?

902
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,232
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

903
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,402
The filthy business

904
01:10:49,123 --> 01:10:52,411
that put those clothes on your back
and our boy in his school,

905
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:54,746
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

906
01:11:04,722 --> 01:11:06,007
Time to go.

907
01:11:06,182 --> 01:11:07,462
I'm not going anywhere with him.

908
01:11:07,683 --> 01:11:08,683
Look at me!

909
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:12,430
And understand...

910
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:15,142
You don't negotiate with a tiger.

911
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:19,309
You admire a tiger until he turns on you

912
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:23,446
and you feel its true fucking nature!

913
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,440
Don't.

914
01:11:26,494 --> 01:11:28,530
You stay right there.

915
01:11:32,124 --> 01:11:34,490
Green. Two minutes.

916
01:11:58,275 --> 01:11:59,435
You are not going to kill me.

917
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:01,316
I already tried.

918
01:12:01,403 --> 01:12:02,518
You pushed me off a boat.

919
01:12:02,613 --> 01:12:04,569
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

920
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:07,273
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

921
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:10,568
No, but you're not angry enough.

922
01:12:12,373 --> 01:12:15,740
Because anger scars over into despair.

923
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:20,044
I look in your eyes...

924
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:23,164
I see despair.

925
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:30,216
Vengeful bitch! Living off me...

926
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:31,881
... thinking that you're better!

927
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:33,139
Enough!

928
01:12:57,668 --> 01:13:00,250
Tell me everything as it happens.

929
01:13:02,631 --> 01:13:04,462
Seal me this side.

930
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:24,103
Yellow, 60 seconds.

931
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:25,814
60. Check.

932
01:13:40,586 --> 01:13:42,998
Blue, 45 seconds.

933
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,995
Blue, 45, check.

934
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:03,931
Okay, red. Coming to you.

935
01:14:19,249 --> 01:14:21,865
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

936
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:08,457
All right, everyone set?

937
01:15:14,304 --> 01:15:16,295
And five...

938
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:18,592
Four...

939
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,560
Three...

940
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:22,645
Two...

941
01:15:24,815 --> 01:15:25,815
One.

942
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:49,540
Go, yellow!

943
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,625
We got a problem!

944
01:15:54,803 --> 01:15:57,545
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

945
01:18:04,016 --> 01:18:06,007
Check the radio chatter.

946
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,305
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

947
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:26,739
This is not one of them.

948
01:18:26,914 --> 01:18:28,495
That's what he's after.

949
01:18:32,252 --> 01:18:33,412
Can't understand this.

950
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:34,997
You said you spoke estonian.

951
01:18:35,172 --> 01:18:36,582
It's not estonian.

952
01:18:36,757 --> 01:18:37,837
It's backwards.

953
01:18:43,263 --> 01:18:44,503
The hell is that?

954
01:18:59,821 --> 01:19:01,152
Go, go, go!

955
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:49,197
Don't give it to him.

956
01:19:49,746 --> 01:19:50,861
This isn't plutonium.

957
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,399
It's worse than that, god damn it!

958
01:20:11,059 --> 01:20:12,094
Sorry.

959
01:20:28,243 --> 01:20:29,243
He's getting away.

960
01:20:31,246 --> 01:20:32,515
He left her in the car!

961
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:34,825
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

962
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:49,511
Pull up alongside!

963
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,612
Come on, come on. Closer!

964
01:21:11,495 --> 01:21:12,985
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

965
01:21:15,123 --> 01:21:16,704
Hurry up!

966
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,370
Please!

967
01:21:55,664 --> 01:21:58,246
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

968
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:00,494
What cavalry?

969
01:23:04,858 --> 01:23:06,940
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

970
01:23:09,654 --> 01:23:11,090
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

971
01:23:11,114 --> 01:23:13,074
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

972
01:23:15,535 --> 01:23:17,180
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

973
01:23:17,204 --> 01:23:18,535
is it really in the BMW?

974
01:23:19,789 --> 01:23:20,789
I don't know.

975
01:23:20,832 --> 01:23:22,288
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!

976
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:25,169
I eave her alone!

977
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:26,702
Kill him!

978
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,711
I don't have time to negotiate.

979
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:35,573
- Listen to me!
- Three.

980
01:23:35,597 --> 01:23:36,597
I can help you.

981
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:37,887
- Help me!
- Two.

982
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:39,058
Please!

983
01:23:39,184 --> 01:23:40,219
- Don't!
- One.

984
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:46,289
Next one's a bullet to the head.

985
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,349
- No!
- One.

986
01:23:49,528 --> 01:23:51,064
Two. Three.

987
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:52,398
Okay! Okay.

988
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,401
The car. The BMW.

989
01:23:55,575 --> 01:23:56,405
I left it in the bmv.

990
01:23:56,493 --> 01:23:58,012
We're going to check
this is real.

991
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:01,789
It's in the glove box!

992
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,918
Where did you leave it?

993
01:24:05,752 --> 01:24:07,868
Car or fire truck, which one?

994
01:24:08,046 --> 01:24:10,886
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

995
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:13,717
I believe you.

996
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:16,377
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

997
01:24:28,775 --> 01:24:29,935
Clear!

998
01:24:30,443 --> 01:24:32,043
Wheeler, go check the other side.

999
01:24:32,153 --> 01:24:33,393
You two.

1000
01:24:33,572 --> 01:24:34,652
Where did he go?

1001
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:35,739
The past.

1002
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:00,370
It's in the glove box!

1003
01:25:00,473 --> 01:25:02,805
We're going to check
this is real.

1004
01:25:05,937 --> 01:25:08,474
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

1005
01:25:08,648 --> 01:25:10,209
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1006
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,851
- No! No!
- One.

1007
01:25:14,029 --> 01:25:15,519
- Listen to me.
- Two.

1008
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,815
Three.

1009
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:18,670
I can help you.

1010
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:20,065
I don't have time to negotiate.

1011
01:25:20,952 --> 01:25:22,232
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

1012
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:25,099
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

1013
01:25:25,123 --> 01:25:26,283
is it really in the BMW?

1014
01:25:26,499 --> 01:25:27,579
I don't know.

1015
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,752
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

1016
01:25:30,545 --> 01:25:31,830
Who told you that?

1017
01:25:32,339 --> 01:25:34,250
If you're not telling the truth,
she dies.

1018
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:36,504
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1019
01:25:48,563 --> 01:25:50,003
- Medic!
- Check in.

1020
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:52,931
She's been shot?

1021
01:25:53,276 --> 01:25:54,857
Bring her back, this side.

1022
01:25:56,404 --> 01:25:58,019
Was she shot with an inverted round?

1023
01:26:03,536 --> 01:26:05,492
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1024
01:26:07,082 --> 01:26:08,947
"Us"! Who are these guys?

1025
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,207
Priya's. Ours.

1026
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:12,868
How did Sator know about the ambush?

1027
01:26:13,046 --> 01:26:14,377
It's posterity.

1028
01:26:14,547 --> 01:26:16,984
An ambush in the middle of the street
can't stay out of the records.

1029
01:26:17,008 --> 01:26:19,966
Bullshit! He knew every move we made!
Every one of 'em.

1030
01:26:20,136 --> 01:26:21,342
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1031
01:26:21,513 --> 01:26:22,753
- Was it you?
- No. No.

1032
01:26:23,598 --> 01:26:25,589
At every stage, you've known too much.

1033
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:28,474
I'm going to ask you again.

1034
01:26:29,396 --> 01:26:31,387
Did you talk?

1035
01:26:33,066 --> 01:26:34,602
Nobody talked.

1036
01:26:34,776 --> 01:26:37,062
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

1037
01:26:37,737 --> 01:26:38,852
A what?

1038
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:42,568
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

1039
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,616
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

1040
01:26:45,787 --> 01:26:48,745
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

1041
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:50,280
knowing everything.

1042
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:52,058
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

1043
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:54,325
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?

1044
01:26:54,421 --> 01:26:55,856
I told you
it was what he was after.

1045
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,246
And you just told him where it was.

1046
01:26:59,175 --> 01:27:00,540
I lied.

1047
01:27:01,594 --> 01:27:04,506
Jesus. You lied about it?

1048
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:07,923
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

1049
01:27:09,018 --> 01:27:11,304
Lying is standard operating procedure.

1050
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:12,639
It's spread too far.

1051
01:27:12,814 --> 01:27:13,814
Meaning what?

1052
01:27:13,898 --> 01:27:15,138
She's gonna die.

1053
01:27:15,316 --> 01:27:16,852
Standard operating procedure.

1054
01:27:17,026 --> 01:27:18,891
Can't you help her? Can we do something?

1055
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,732
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation
by inverting the patient?

1056
01:27:21,906 --> 01:27:22,736
Takes days.

1057
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:24,067
Let's go.

1058
01:27:24,242 --> 01:27:27,200
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

1059
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,406
How long is she gonna live on this side?

1060
01:27:29,581 --> 01:27:31,071
Three hours, tops.

1061
01:27:31,249 --> 01:27:32,739
I'm taking her through.

1062
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:34,999
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

1063
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:37,126
There's no way of bringing you back.

1064
01:27:37,797 --> 01:27:38,877
We find another machine.

1065
01:27:39,048 --> 01:27:40,458
A week ago? Where?

1066
01:27:42,552 --> 01:27:44,042
Oslo.

1067
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,632
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

1068
01:27:46,806 --> 01:27:47,921
It's impregnable.

1069
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,431
Mmm... it wasn't last week.

1070
01:27:50,769 --> 01:27:52,100
We're going in.

1071
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,310
You might as well help us.

1072
01:27:54,814 --> 01:27:55,974
This is a proving window.

1073
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:57,434
As you approach the turnstile,

1074
01:27:57,609 --> 01:27:59,295
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

1075
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:00,354
do not enter the machine.

1076
01:28:00,528 --> 01:28:01,358
Why not?

1077
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:03,340
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

1078
01:28:03,364 --> 01:28:04,425
then you ain't getting out.

1079
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:06,440
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

1080
01:28:07,076 --> 01:28:08,407
See for yourself.

1081
01:28:09,078 --> 01:28:10,909
There's your answer. Let's go.

1082
01:28:35,688 --> 01:28:36,957
She's stabilizing slowly.

1083
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:38,661
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

1084
01:28:38,817 --> 01:28:40,102
How long does she need?

1085
01:28:40,276 --> 01:28:42,562
Four, five days. A week to be sure.

1086
01:28:43,822 --> 01:28:45,382
Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo.

1087
01:28:45,406 --> 01:28:46,406
I'm going back out there.

1088
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:49,691
To do what?

1089
01:28:49,869 --> 01:28:52,549
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

1090
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,616
You didn't. You lied about where it was.

1091
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:55,791
Wait.

1092
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:57,786
You're going out there for her.

1093
01:28:57,961 --> 01:28:59,481
He threatened to kill her in the past.

1094
01:28:59,629 --> 01:29:01,109
If he does, what happens to her here?

1095
01:29:02,757 --> 01:29:04,622
That's unknowable.

1096
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:07,029
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

1097
01:29:07,053 --> 01:29:08,338
What do you believe?

1098
01:29:08,513 --> 01:29:10,629
What has happened has happened.

1099
01:29:10,807 --> 01:29:13,594
We need to save her, here and now.

1100
01:29:13,768 --> 01:29:16,726
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

1101
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,266
Don't let them
take her back through there.

1102
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:20,479
Okay?

1103
01:29:20,567 --> 01:29:22,148
We can't stay here.

1104
01:29:23,278 --> 01:29:24,734
We don't have a lot of time.

1105
01:29:24,904 --> 01:29:27,987
So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container

1106
01:29:28,157 --> 01:29:30,239
That has just come off a ship from Oslo?

1107
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,820
This is cowboy shit.

1108
01:29:31,911 --> 01:29:33,472
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into

1109
01:29:33,496 --> 01:29:34,616
if you go through that door.

1110
01:29:34,747 --> 01:29:36,612
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

1111
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:38,031
Wheeler, brief him.

1112
01:29:38,626 --> 01:29:40,082
You'll need your own air.

1113
01:29:40,253 --> 01:29:43,416
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

1114
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:44,705
Number one rule:

1115
01:29:44,883 --> 01:29:47,374
Don't come into contact
with your forward self.

1116
01:29:47,552 --> 01:29:50,043
It's the whole point of these barriers
and protective suits.

1117
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:51,631
We don't have time.

1118
01:29:51,806 --> 01:29:53,842
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

1119
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:55,017
What?

1120
01:29:55,101 --> 01:29:56,101
Annihilation.

1121
01:29:56,227 --> 01:29:58,092
That would be bad, right?

1122
01:29:58,271 --> 01:30:01,980
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

1123
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,435
Things will feel strange.

1124
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:06,647
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

1125
01:30:06,738 --> 01:30:09,855
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

1126
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:11,610
as the transfer of heat is reversed.

1127
01:30:11,784 --> 01:30:15,743
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

1128
01:30:16,831 --> 01:30:19,243
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

1129
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:20,657
This is normal.

1130
01:30:20,835 --> 01:30:22,496
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

1131
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,270
I can't vouch for the handling.

1132
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:25,958
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

1133
01:30:26,633 --> 01:30:28,715
You are inverted. The world is not.

1134
01:30:28,885 --> 01:30:30,500
Was the transponder on the case?

1135
01:30:30,678 --> 01:30:32,339
We've tossed that case.

1136
01:30:32,513 --> 01:30:34,970
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

1137
01:30:35,141 --> 01:30:36,802
Give me the reader.

1138
01:30:40,897 --> 01:30:42,137
Okay.

1139
01:30:43,191 --> 01:30:44,476
You ready?

1140
01:33:36,322 --> 01:33:38,688
The material's not in the case.

1141
01:33:39,617 --> 01:33:42,279
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

1142
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:44,577
He was lying.

1143
01:33:44,747 --> 01:33:46,453
It wasn't in the BMW.

1144
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,624
So, where is it?

1145
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,791
I saw the handoff.

1146
01:34:35,965 --> 01:34:38,422
You made me shoot her for nothing.

1147
01:34:39,343 --> 01:34:43,131
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

1148
01:34:43,306 --> 01:34:44,842
Not even my wife.

1149
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:17,002
You left Ives and his team
a hell of a cleanup.

1150
01:35:18,299 --> 01:35:20,290
Heat transfer was reversed.

1151
01:35:21,177 --> 01:35:22,963
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

1152
01:35:23,054 --> 01:35:25,215
from a gasoline explosion in history.

1153
01:35:25,306 --> 01:35:27,968
At this point,
nothing surprises.

1154
01:35:29,644 --> 01:35:30,759
We're headed back to Oslo?

1155
01:35:30,937 --> 01:35:32,802
In a Rotas shipping container.

1156
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:34,309
He's got the material, Neil.

1157
01:35:35,107 --> 01:35:36,938
I handed it to him on a plate.

1158
01:35:37,235 --> 01:35:38,566
I warned you...

1159
01:35:38,736 --> 01:35:39,851
What has happened has happened.

1160
01:35:40,029 --> 01:35:41,565
I get it now.

1161
01:35:41,739 --> 01:35:44,651
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

1162
01:35:45,701 --> 01:35:46,531
That's not fair.

1163
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:48,784
You were a part of this before we met.

1164
01:35:49,538 --> 01:35:50,618
Were you working for Priya?

1165
01:35:50,748 --> 01:35:51,578
No.

1166
01:35:51,749 --> 01:35:52,989
Who recruited you, Neil?

1167
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:56,663
It can't possibly do you any good
to know that right now.

1168
01:35:56,837 --> 01:36:01,672
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

1169
01:36:01,842 --> 01:36:04,458
then you can hear my life story, okay?

1170
01:36:06,806 --> 01:36:08,467
I'm sorry I involved you.

1171
01:36:08,641 --> 01:36:10,347
You need to tell me what's going on.

1172
01:36:10,518 --> 01:36:13,225
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

1173
01:36:13,396 --> 01:36:14,396
Good luck, pal.

1174
01:36:14,563 --> 01:36:17,396
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

1175
01:36:17,566 --> 01:36:20,023
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

1176
01:36:20,194 --> 01:36:22,310
She has the right to know
why she might die.

1177
01:36:22,488 --> 01:36:23,568
Am I gonna die?

1178
01:36:23,739 --> 01:36:25,339
Not if we have something
to say about it.

1179
01:36:25,408 --> 01:36:26,408
And we do.

1180
01:36:26,701 --> 01:36:28,157
Who are you?

1181
01:36:29,328 --> 01:36:32,820
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

1182
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:41,128
The material's not in the case.

1183
01:36:41,257 --> 01:36:44,420
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

1184
01:36:53,519 --> 01:36:54,554
You injured?

1185
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:02,350
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1186
01:37:04,322 --> 01:37:07,405
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

1187
01:37:08,909 --> 01:37:11,070
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

1188
01:37:11,162 --> 01:37:12,902
so it can't be copied or communicated.

1189
01:37:13,914 --> 01:37:15,620
It's a black box with one function.

1190
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,865
Which is?

1191
01:37:18,753 --> 01:37:21,495
Inversion. But not objects or peoples.

1192
01:37:21,672 --> 01:37:22,752
The world around us.

1193
01:37:22,923 --> 01:37:23,923
I don't understand.

1194
01:37:24,091 --> 01:37:27,208
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

1195
01:37:27,386 --> 01:37:31,004
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

1196
01:37:31,182 --> 01:37:34,219
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

1197
01:37:34,518 --> 01:37:35,518
We dominate.

1198
01:37:35,686 --> 01:37:37,267
They're always swimming upstream.

1199
01:37:37,438 --> 01:37:38,553
It's what saved your life.

1200
01:37:38,731 --> 01:37:41,347
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

1201
01:37:41,692 --> 01:37:42,692
Pissing in the wind.

1202
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:45,647
And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.

1203
01:37:45,821 --> 01:37:48,187
It can invert the entropy of the world.

1204
01:37:49,033 --> 01:37:50,148
And if that happens?

1205
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:51,486
Oh...

1206
01:37:52,203 --> 01:37:53,318
End of play.

1207
01:37:53,829 --> 01:37:55,911
"End of play.”
can you be a little more precise?

1208
01:37:56,082 --> 01:37:59,540
Everyone and everything
that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.

1209
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:00,710
Precise enough?

1210
01:38:00,878 --> 01:38:02,493
Including my son.

1211
01:38:05,674 --> 01:38:08,757
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

1212
01:38:24,568 --> 01:38:25,853
On a truck.

1213
01:38:28,197 --> 01:38:29,482
Shouldn't be long now.

1214
01:38:30,825 --> 01:38:32,816
I've been thinking.

1215
01:38:32,993 --> 01:38:34,824
We're their ancestors.

1216
01:38:35,162 --> 01:38:37,528
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

1217
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,122
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

1218
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:41,452
The what?

1219
01:38:42,378 --> 01:38:43,788
If you went back in time

1220
01:38:43,963 --> 01:38:45,243
and killed your own grandfather,

1221
01:38:45,339 --> 01:38:47,375
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

1222
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,380
What's the answer?

1223
01:38:48,551 --> 01:38:50,132
There's no answer. It's a paradox.

1224
01:38:50,803 --> 01:38:51,803
But in the future,

1225
01:38:51,887 --> 01:38:53,718
those in power clearly believe
that you can

1226
01:38:53,889 --> 01:38:55,174
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1227
01:38:55,349 --> 01:38:56,964
gouge his eyes out,

1228
01:38:57,143 --> 01:38:58,303
slit his throat,

1229
01:38:58,477 --> 01:38:59,592
without consequence.

1230
01:39:00,187 --> 01:39:01,802
Could they be right?

1231
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:03,437
Doesn't matter.

1232
01:39:03,607 --> 01:39:05,347
They believe it.

1233
01:39:05,526 --> 01:39:07,517
So they're willing to destroy us.

1234
01:39:09,363 --> 01:39:10,944
Can I go back to sleep now?

1235
01:39:11,115 --> 01:39:12,395
No. I thought of something else.

1236
01:39:12,533 --> 01:39:13,363
Great.

1237
01:39:13,534 --> 01:39:15,650
This reversing the flow of time.

1238
01:39:15,786 --> 01:39:18,448
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

1239
01:39:18,622 --> 01:39:19,657
That we stop them?

1240
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:22,702
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.

1241
01:39:23,294 --> 01:39:24,500
Pessimistically?

1242
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:27,412
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

1243
01:39:27,506 --> 01:39:30,498
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

1244
01:39:30,676 --> 01:39:31,916
Does your head hurt yet?

1245
01:39:32,094 --> 01:39:33,254
Yes.

1246
01:39:37,183 --> 01:39:38,593
Try to sleep.

1247
01:39:53,657 --> 01:39:54,863
Shit.

1248
01:39:56,285 --> 01:39:58,241
They didn't take us inside.

1249
01:39:59,497 --> 01:40:01,112
What do we do?

1250
01:40:04,502 --> 01:40:05,502
We use the breach.

1251
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:07,785
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

1252
01:40:10,758 --> 01:40:12,248
She healed enough?

1253
01:40:13,177 --> 01:40:14,883
I don't know.

1254
01:40:15,054 --> 01:40:16,510
I've never done this before.

1255
01:40:16,597 --> 01:40:19,088
The fire crew's there.

1256
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:20,551
You take Kat through the breach,

1257
01:40:20,768 --> 01:40:22,648
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

1258
01:40:22,728 --> 01:40:24,218
Then you bring her in.

1259
01:40:25,773 --> 01:40:26,773
How's your arm?

1260
01:40:26,941 --> 01:40:28,477
Not good.

1261
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,861
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

1262
01:40:39,495 --> 01:40:40,575
Hold on, hold on. “What?

1263
01:40:40,788 --> 01:40:41,948
You're bleeding.

1264
01:40:42,706 --> 01:40:44,146
All right, let me take a look at it.

1265
01:40:50,673 --> 01:40:51,673
Ready?

1266
01:41:24,665 --> 01:41:26,185
Wait here. I'm going in.

1267
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:24,659
Come on!

1268
01:43:24,952 --> 01:43:25,987
Go, go, go!

1269
01:43:56,316 --> 01:43:57,316
Go!

1270
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:41,314
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

1271
01:45:41,338 --> 01:45:42,578
Why didn't you say?

1272
01:45:42,756 --> 01:45:43,796
That's a lot of explaining

1273
01:45:43,841 --> 01:45:45,860
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

1274
01:45:45,884 --> 01:45:46,884
But afterwards?

1275
01:45:47,302 --> 01:45:50,294
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.

1276
01:45:50,472 --> 01:45:51,632
What has happened has happened.

1277
01:45:52,224 --> 01:45:55,261
If I told you and you acted differently,
who knows?

1278
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:59,056
The policy is to suppress.

1279
01:45:59,565 --> 01:46:01,271
Whose policy?

1280
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:02,601
Ours, my friend.

1281
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,147
We're the people saving the world
from what might've been.

1282
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:20,081
Kat?

1283
01:46:21,044 --> 01:46:22,284
I'm here.

1284
01:46:23,297 --> 01:46:24,457
It'll be quite a scar.

1285
01:46:24,923 --> 01:46:26,129
You'll be okay.

1286
01:46:28,594 --> 01:46:29,594
Did it.

1287
01:46:30,012 --> 01:46:31,127
You did what?

1288
01:46:31,972 --> 01:46:33,587
Andrei has the algorithm.

1289
01:46:34,766 --> 01:46:36,506
You don't know where he is.

1290
01:46:38,687 --> 01:46:39,893
Or when.

1291
01:46:41,273 --> 01:46:43,559
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1292
01:46:43,734 --> 01:46:46,396
If I don't do something, in two days,
she tells me about the 241.

1293
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:47,730
Nothing can change that.

1294
01:46:48,155 --> 01:46:49,155
We'll see.

1295
01:46:49,948 --> 01:46:51,279
Just get her here.

1296
01:46:53,911 --> 01:46:54,991
Hello, Priya.

1297
01:46:55,954 --> 01:46:57,194
What's going on?

1298
01:46:57,372 --> 01:46:58,782
Where's Neil?

1299
01:46:58,957 --> 01:47:02,449
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

1300
01:47:02,628 --> 01:47:03,628
What did I do?

1301
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:04,830
It's what you're going to do.

1302
01:47:04,922 --> 01:47:07,584
In two days, you're gonna have me
dangle Plutonium-241...

1303
01:47:07,758 --> 01:47:09,999
... in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1304
01:47:10,177 --> 01:47:11,713
Now, I wanna know why.

1305
01:47:11,887 --> 01:47:14,003
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1306
01:47:14,181 --> 01:47:15,921
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

1307
01:47:17,559 --> 01:47:19,390
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1308
01:47:20,062 --> 01:47:22,519
It's... it's unique.

1309
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:24,429
The scientist who built it
took her own life

1310
01:47:24,608 --> 01:47:26,210
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

1311
01:47:26,234 --> 01:47:27,274
A scientist in the future?

1312
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:28,434
Generations from now.

1313
01:47:28,612 --> 01:47:30,022
Why does she have to kill herself?

1314
01:47:30,503 --> 01:47:32,503
Are you familiar with the Manhattan project?

1315
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,315
As they approached
the first atomic test,

1316
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:36,820
Oppenheimer became concerned

1317
01:47:36,995 --> 01:47:39,702
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

1318
01:47:39,873 --> 01:47:40,908
engulfing the world.

1319
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:42,869
They went ahead anyway and got lucky.

1320
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:46,994
Think of our scientist
as her generation's Oppenheimer.

1321
01:47:47,589 --> 01:47:49,921
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

1322
01:47:50,092 --> 01:47:52,674
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

1323
01:47:52,844 --> 01:47:54,300
they're destroying themselves.

1324
01:47:54,471 --> 01:47:56,211
The grandfather paradox.

1325
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,176
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1326
01:47:58,350 --> 01:47:59,590
she rebels,

1327
01:47:59,768 --> 01:48:01,850
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

1328
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:04,391
and hiding them
the best place she can think of.

1329
01:48:04,982 --> 01:48:05,982
The past.

1330
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:07,184
Here, now.

1331
01:48:07,359 --> 01:48:09,566
There are nine nuclear powers.

1332
01:48:09,736 --> 01:48:10,736
Nine bombs.

1333
01:48:11,238 --> 01:48:14,651
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

1334
01:48:14,825 --> 01:48:16,781
The best hiding place possible.

1335
01:48:16,952 --> 01:48:18,988
Nuclear containment facilities.

1336
01:48:19,788 --> 01:48:21,198
Sator's lifelong mission,

1337
01:48:21,373 --> 01:48:23,830
financed and guided by the future,
has been to

1338
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:26,208
find and reassemble the algorithm.

1339
01:48:26,378 --> 01:48:27,618
Why do they choose him?

1340
01:48:27,796 --> 01:48:29,732
Because he was at the right place
at the right time.

1341
01:48:29,756 --> 01:48:31,917
The collapse of the Soviet Union.

1342
01:48:32,092 --> 01:48:35,175
The most insecure moment
in the history of nuclear weapons.

1343
01:48:35,345 --> 01:48:37,506
How many sections does he have?

1344
01:48:37,681 --> 01:48:39,262
After the 241, all nine.

1345
01:48:39,433 --> 01:48:40,923
Jesus Christ.

1346
01:48:41,518 --> 01:48:44,476
And that's why you're going
to do things differently this time.

1347
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:46,849
To change things?

1348
01:48:47,024 --> 01:48:48,264
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1349
01:48:48,442 --> 01:48:50,558
So Sator won't get the algorithm.

1350
01:48:52,654 --> 01:48:54,519
If that universe can exist...

1351
01:48:55,198 --> 01:48:56,198
We don't live in it.

1352
01:48:56,366 --> 01:48:57,651
Well, let's try.

1353
01:48:58,368 --> 01:49:00,074
You're going to warn me.

1354
01:49:00,245 --> 01:49:01,906
No, I'm not.

1355
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,445
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1356
01:49:03,623 --> 01:49:04,658
Come on.

1357
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:07,074
If you had known what the algorithm was,

1358
01:49:07,252 --> 01:49:09,368
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

1359
01:49:10,797 --> 01:49:12,662
You want Sator to get the last section.

1360
01:49:12,841 --> 01:49:15,332
That is the only way
he'll bring together the other eight.

1361
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:17,171
I was supposed to steal it...

1362
01:49:17,637 --> 01:49:18,717
Then lose it?

1363
01:49:18,889 --> 01:49:20,254
Mission accomplished.

1364
01:49:20,807 --> 01:49:22,217
You used me.

1365
01:49:23,268 --> 01:49:24,599
As you used Katherine.

1366
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,181
Standard operating procedure.

1367
01:49:28,815 --> 01:49:30,055
You've done your part.

1368
01:49:30,776 --> 01:49:31,776
My part?

1369
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:34,567
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

1370
01:49:34,738 --> 01:49:35,853
You...

1371
01:49:36,031 --> 01:49:37,817
Are a protagonist.

1372
01:49:37,991 --> 01:49:40,824
Did you think you were the only one
capable of saving the world?

1373
01:49:45,624 --> 01:49:46,624
No.

1374
01:49:48,001 --> 01:49:49,411
But I am.

1375
01:49:49,586 --> 01:49:50,626
Because I haven't told you

1376
01:49:50,796 --> 01:49:52,707
where he's assembling the algorithm
or when.

1377
01:49:52,881 --> 01:49:53,961
You're about to.

1378
01:49:54,132 --> 01:49:55,542
No, I'm not.

1379
01:49:55,717 --> 01:49:56,797
So, deal us in.

1380
01:49:58,011 --> 01:49:59,046
"Us"?

1381
01:49:59,596 --> 01:50:01,115
Why would you want to involve her again?

1382
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:02,459
Because she can get close to him.

1383
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:03,884
Does he still trust her?

1384
01:50:04,059 --> 01:50:05,219
He thinks she's dead.

1385
01:50:05,393 --> 01:50:06,553
But he used to.

1386
01:50:06,728 --> 01:50:09,014
You have started looking at the world
in a new way.

1387
01:50:09,189 --> 01:50:10,554
And now, it's your turn.

1388
01:50:10,732 --> 01:50:12,313
Assuming she makes it out alive,

1389
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,356
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

1390
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,358
I can't.

1391
01:50:15,529 --> 01:50:16,714
If you don't have the authority,

1392
01:50:16,738 --> 01:50:19,354
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

1393
01:50:19,533 --> 01:50:21,273
I need your word

1394
01:50:21,451 --> 01:50:23,908
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

1395
01:50:24,496 --> 01:50:26,536
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1396
01:50:32,337 --> 01:50:33,337
They'll be safe.

1397
01:50:35,298 --> 01:50:37,380
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

1398
01:50:37,551 --> 01:50:39,007
Get yourselves up there.

1399
01:50:39,177 --> 01:50:40,963
Ives has a team ready to invert.

1400
01:50:41,138 --> 01:50:42,538
You have a turnstile?

1401
01:50:42,597 --> 01:50:45,134
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

1402
01:50:45,308 --> 01:50:47,424
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

1403
01:50:48,019 --> 01:50:50,305
But there are some people,
in the future,

1404
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,597
who want to continue
the algorithm's journey into the past.

1405
01:50:54,693 --> 01:50:56,274
You see...

1406
01:50:56,444 --> 01:50:59,231
Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

1407
01:50:59,406 --> 01:51:02,068
It will be founded in the future.

1408
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,641
Can't get over the birds.

1409
01:51:30,812 --> 01:51:32,552
How're you feeling?

1410
01:51:37,903 --> 01:51:39,439
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1411
01:51:40,197 --> 01:51:41,027
I can't.

1412
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:42,278
Why not?

1413
01:51:42,449 --> 01:51:44,280
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

1414
01:51:44,451 --> 01:51:46,487
Not with a dead man's switch.

1415
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:48,401
The fitness tracker he wears.

1416
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:50,110
He's obsessive about his health.

1417
01:51:50,165 --> 01:51:51,475
It'll be linked to a switch,

1418
01:51:51,499 --> 01:51:53,615
probably a simple e-mail burst

1419
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,390
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

1420
01:51:55,503 --> 01:51:57,334
set to fire if his heart stops.

1421
01:51:57,505 --> 01:51:59,666
His death activates the algorithm.

1422
01:51:59,841 --> 01:52:01,331
He dies, the world ends.

1423
01:52:01,676 --> 01:52:03,257
No one dares kill him.

1424
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:07,550
No, you've missed the point.

1425
01:52:09,893 --> 01:52:11,303
He's intending to end his life.

1426
01:52:13,772 --> 01:52:14,772
Why?

1427
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:17,809
He's dying.

1428
01:52:19,103 --> 01:52:21,903
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1429
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:24,441
And he's taking the world with him.

1430
01:52:24,616 --> 01:52:26,652
If he can't have her, no one can.

1431
01:52:26,993 --> 01:52:30,656
He gets to choose the time and place
for the end of the world.

1432
01:52:31,081 --> 01:52:33,493
What moment? What does he choose?

1433
01:52:35,543 --> 01:52:38,250
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1434
01:52:38,755 --> 01:52:39,961
Vietnam.

1435
01:52:40,131 --> 01:52:41,746
You said he vanished. What day?

1436
01:52:41,925 --> 01:52:44,695
I went ashore with Max and he flew off,
but I don't know what day it was.

1437
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,801
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1438
01:52:46,972 --> 01:52:47,972
He was in Ukraine.

1439
01:52:48,431 --> 01:52:49,921
At the Kiev opera siege.

1440
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:52,386
How do you know about that?

1441
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:56,090
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht,
so that's his window.

1442
01:52:56,147 --> 01:52:58,559
To go back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.

1443
01:52:58,733 --> 01:52:59,933
Everyone's last.

1444
01:53:00,235 --> 01:53:02,115
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

1445
01:53:02,153 --> 01:53:03,188
without Sator knowing.

1446
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,566
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

1447
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:07,196
And not the rest of us.

1448
01:53:07,367 --> 01:53:08,447
Where's the dead drop?

1449
01:53:08,618 --> 01:53:10,154
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1450
01:53:10,328 --> 01:53:11,328
You're not gonna tell me?

1451
01:53:11,496 --> 01:53:12,616
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1452
01:53:13,081 --> 01:53:14,662
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.

1453
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:15,868
Why?

1454
01:53:16,084 --> 01:53:19,042
You have to stop him killing himself
until we know the algorithm

1455
01:53:19,212 --> 01:53:21,077
is out of the dead drop.

1456
01:53:21,256 --> 01:53:23,247
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.

1457
01:53:23,425 --> 01:53:25,152
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

1458
01:53:25,176 --> 01:53:27,167
if they're gonna be his last.

1459
01:53:28,013 --> 01:53:29,093
They're not.

1460
01:53:54,247 --> 01:53:55,247
It's time.

1461
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:56,996
We're working our way back to the 14th,

1462
01:53:57,083 --> 01:53:58,763
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

1463
01:53:58,835 --> 01:54:01,042
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

1464
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:04,211
You know what a hypocenter is?

1465
01:54:05,592 --> 01:54:07,924
It's ground zero
for an underground nuclear test.

1466
01:54:08,094 --> 01:54:13,134
Sir Michael Crosby told me about
a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1467
01:54:13,308 --> 01:54:15,390
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

1468
01:54:15,503 --> 01:54:18,203
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1469
01:54:18,646 --> 01:54:20,333
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

1470
01:54:20,357 --> 01:54:22,348
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1471
01:54:24,778 --> 01:54:26,143
Line it up.

1472
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:27,571
Move forward.

1473
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:30,699
Next.

1474
01:54:34,996 --> 01:54:35,996
Line it up.

1475
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:38,951
Where's Neil?

1476
01:54:42,128 --> 01:54:43,408
He must've gone through already.

1477
01:54:43,505 --> 01:54:44,625
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1478
01:54:45,298 --> 01:54:46,754
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1479
01:54:46,925 --> 01:54:48,290
I'd like to say...

1480
01:54:48,802 --> 01:54:50,321
That you don't have to do this, Kat...

1481
01:54:50,345 --> 01:54:53,712
Worst thing Andrei ever did to me
was that offer he made me.

1482
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:56,882
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

1483
01:54:58,228 --> 01:54:59,968
I shouted and...

1484
01:55:00,313 --> 01:55:01,723
Swore.

1485
01:55:02,524 --> 01:55:04,765
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

1486
01:55:08,196 --> 01:55:09,686
I considered it.

1487
01:55:10,532 --> 01:55:12,739
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1488
01:55:12,909 --> 01:55:14,740
or because he knows that about me.

1489
01:55:18,164 --> 01:55:19,745
A chance to help save my child.

1490
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:21,513
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

1491
01:55:21,918 --> 01:55:22,748
No.

1492
01:55:22,919 --> 01:55:24,784
You've killed people
you've hated before.

1493
01:55:25,296 --> 01:55:26,581
It's not usually personal.

1494
01:55:26,756 --> 01:55:28,734
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1495
01:55:28,758 --> 01:55:30,373
It always counts, Kat.

1496
01:55:30,844 --> 01:55:33,506
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

1497
01:55:34,514 --> 01:55:37,005
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

1498
01:55:37,183 --> 01:55:38,798
he takes us all with him.

1499
01:55:41,521 --> 01:55:43,603
You just keep up your end, okay?

1500
01:55:47,777 --> 01:55:49,017
Today's the 14th.

1501
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:50,689
Offshore of Siberia.

1502
01:55:50,864 --> 01:55:52,195
Time for us to go.

1503
01:55:52,365 --> 01:55:53,645
You keep going back another day,

1504
01:55:53,741 --> 01:55:55,527
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

1505
01:55:55,702 --> 01:55:56,846
And who gets me on the yacht?

1506
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:58,150
I've got somebody good lined up.

1507
01:55:58,246 --> 01:56:01,329
When it's over, when you're raising
your boy, carry this.

1508
01:56:01,791 --> 01:56:04,123
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

1509
01:56:04,294 --> 01:56:06,956
Hit "talk", state your location,
hang up.

1510
01:56:07,422 --> 01:56:09,003
Who gets the message?

1511
01:56:09,466 --> 01:56:11,081
Posterity.

1512
01:56:50,507 --> 01:56:51,838
Stalsk-12.

1513
01:56:52,008 --> 01:56:55,375
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

1514
01:56:55,553 --> 01:56:59,717
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1515
01:56:59,891 --> 01:57:03,475
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1516
01:57:03,645 --> 01:57:04,930
We're red team, moving forward.

1517
01:57:05,104 --> 01:57:07,595
In order to distinguish the teams,
you'll wear these.

1518
01:57:07,774 --> 01:57:08,934
Our friends over there,

1519
01:57:09,108 --> 01:57:11,474
blue team, led by commander Wheeler,
are inverted.

1520
01:57:11,653 --> 01:57:13,393
Why don't they let us see them?

1521
01:57:13,905 --> 01:57:15,265
Maybe we won't like what happened.

1522
01:57:15,406 --> 01:57:18,239
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

1523
01:57:20,203 --> 01:57:23,445
Then, were dropped on the Ridge
above the hypocenter,

1524
01:57:23,623 --> 01:57:25,830
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

1525
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,834
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

1526
01:57:30,004 --> 01:57:33,747
Now, this briefing
has the benefit of their experience.

1527
01:57:50,692 --> 01:57:52,523
Both teams have countdown watches.

1528
01:57:52,694 --> 01:57:55,060
Ours counts down from ten, from landing

1529
01:57:55,238 --> 01:57:56,694
to zero to the explosion.

1530
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,801
- Blue team is reversed.
- Everybody, look to your left.

1531
01:57:58,825 --> 01:58:02,818
If you are not at the LZ at zero,
you are not leaving.

1532
01:58:03,913 --> 01:58:05,198
Do you understand?

1533
01:58:05,498 --> 01:58:08,990
We drop in, clear LZs
for blue team evacuation.

1534
01:58:09,168 --> 01:58:10,783
We make our way into the city proper.

1535
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,377
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

1536
01:58:13,548 --> 01:58:15,004
there is a turnstile.

1537
01:58:15,174 --> 01:58:17,085
Expect a bitemporal response.

1538
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,670
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1539
01:58:18,845 --> 01:58:21,086
Inverse, conventional,

1540
01:58:21,264 --> 01:58:23,755
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

1541
01:58:24,475 --> 01:58:25,885
On the other side of the city,

1542
01:58:25,977 --> 01:58:28,434
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

1543
01:58:28,605 --> 01:58:31,813
A splinter unit
will take this tunnel from the city

1544
01:58:31,983 --> 01:58:33,814
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1545
01:58:33,985 --> 01:58:36,522
Blue team located an entrance here.

1546
01:58:36,696 --> 01:58:38,732
The bomb is in this rock,

1547
01:58:38,906 --> 01:58:41,739
high above, to trigger a collapse,

1548
01:58:41,909 --> 01:58:42,944
sealing the cavern.

1549
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:44,575
How do we defuse the bomb up there?

1550
01:58:44,662 --> 01:58:47,244
We don't.
The explosion takes place as planned.

1551
01:58:47,415 --> 01:58:51,249
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

1552
01:58:51,419 --> 01:58:54,786
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1553
01:58:54,922 --> 01:58:55,922
Which is?

1554
01:58:56,007 --> 01:58:57,127
Need-to-know, and you don't.

1555
01:58:58,092 --> 01:58:59,753
Any other stupid questions?

1556
01:59:00,136 --> 01:59:02,422
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.

1557
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:06,760
I wanted to be on the first wave.

1558
01:59:06,934 --> 01:59:08,299
There is no first wave.

1559
01:59:08,478 --> 01:59:10,935
Red team and blue team
operate simultaneously.

1560
01:59:11,105 --> 01:59:12,105
Look,

1561
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:14,870
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1562
01:59:15,026 --> 01:59:18,439
Now, you wanna be on the team
that lifts the contents of the capsule?

1563
01:59:18,613 --> 01:59:20,103
Absolutely.

1564
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:22,150
Yeah, that's us.

1565
01:59:22,909 --> 01:59:24,149
We're splinter unit.

1566
01:59:24,327 --> 01:59:25,407
Just us?

1567
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:29,078
No one who knows the contents
of that capsule can leave the field.

1568
01:59:29,999 --> 01:59:32,456
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1569
01:59:42,345 --> 01:59:44,323
It's 40 feet
from the private deck to the water.

1570
01:59:44,347 --> 01:59:45,347
Can you jump it?

1571
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:47,380
I can dive it.

1572
01:59:48,033 --> 01:59:50,453
When you see my signal,
you'll know when to dive.

1573
02:00:25,888 --> 02:00:27,253
Thirty seconds!

1574
02:01:08,347 --> 02:01:09,347
Go! Go! Go!

1575
02:01:21,194 --> 02:01:22,980
We're coming in on a shockwave.

1576
02:01:23,154 --> 02:01:24,314
Hang on, people.

1577
02:01:33,498 --> 02:01:34,783
On your feet!

1578
02:01:48,513 --> 02:01:49,878
There!

1579
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:04,797
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

1580
02:02:04,821 --> 02:02:06,341
Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

1581
02:02:06,447 --> 02:02:07,447
Oh, the boss left.

1582
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:11,066
Well, have Mr. Sator find me here.

1583
02:02:11,244 --> 02:02:12,529
And don't tell the others.

1584
02:02:12,703 --> 02:02:13,943
I'll get the mess.

1585
02:03:21,564 --> 02:03:22,564
Mines!

1586
02:03:22,773 --> 02:03:23,773
Mines!

1587
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,640
They told me you'd gone ashore.

1588
02:03:41,709 --> 02:03:42,869
They told me you'd flown off.

1589
02:03:43,002 --> 02:03:45,118
I came back to see you and Max.

1590
02:03:45,296 --> 02:03:47,161
Max is on shore with Anna.

1591
02:03:48,633 --> 02:03:50,360
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1592
02:03:50,384 --> 02:03:52,750
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

1593
02:03:53,471 --> 02:03:54,927
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1594
02:03:55,097 --> 02:03:58,510
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1595
02:04:06,442 --> 02:04:08,774
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1596
02:04:24,418 --> 02:04:25,578
Take cover!

1597
02:04:29,966 --> 02:04:31,752
Get me a goddamn AT-4!

1598
02:04:31,926 --> 02:04:33,166
Take him out, now!

1599
02:04:33,761 --> 02:04:35,171
Provide some cover!

1600
02:04:35,346 --> 02:04:37,177
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1601
02:04:37,348 --> 02:04:38,633
Move, move, move!

1602
02:05:49,003 --> 02:05:50,003
Wheeler!

1603
02:05:51,547 --> 02:05:52,547
Get outta there!

1604
02:05:52,715 --> 02:05:53,875
Come on!

1605
02:05:59,555 --> 02:06:00,555
Ives!

1606
02:06:02,641 --> 02:06:04,256
Splinter unit. Here.

1607
02:06:06,062 --> 02:06:08,178
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

1608
02:06:08,355 --> 02:06:12,314
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

1609
02:06:12,943 --> 02:06:14,934
I'll make you a drink.

1610
02:06:15,905 --> 02:06:17,896
Bring my son back to the boat.

1611
02:06:24,413 --> 02:06:25,724
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!

1612
02:06:25,748 --> 02:06:27,830
If they see us, it's all for nothing.

1613
02:06:31,629 --> 02:06:32,744
We need a distraction.

1614
02:06:32,922 --> 02:06:34,458
Don't worry about that.

1615
02:06:38,135 --> 02:06:39,545
On my mark!

1616
02:06:42,389 --> 02:06:44,004
RPG, hit the base!

1617
02:06:45,059 --> 02:06:46,339
That building. On my mark!

1618
02:06:48,229 --> 02:06:50,015
Three! Two!

1619
02:06:50,189 --> 02:06:51,929
One! Fire!

1620
02:06:53,067 --> 02:06:54,227
Fire!

1621
02:07:09,208 --> 02:07:10,539
Move! Move!

1622
02:07:26,267 --> 02:07:28,258
We're committed now. Come on.

1623
02:07:34,567 --> 02:07:36,148
What's that?

1624
02:07:36,318 --> 02:07:38,775
I borrowed it from the CIA.

1625
02:07:40,114 --> 02:07:41,149
What is it?

1626
02:07:41,323 --> 02:07:43,564
The way the world ends.

1627
02:07:43,742 --> 02:07:46,199
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1628
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,326
I don't understand.

1629
02:07:48,497 --> 02:07:50,408
When I take this, it's all over.

1630
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,198
Then don't take it yet.

1631
02:07:56,255 --> 02:07:57,870
Why not?

1632
02:07:59,466 --> 02:08:01,377
Because we have the sunset coming.

1633
02:08:01,844 --> 02:08:04,301
And a little vodka left.

1634
02:08:04,471 --> 02:08:06,427
And Max will be here soon.

1635
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:10,592
They said they thought it was you,
not Anna, ashore with Max.

1636
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:16,852
As long as you can tell the difference...

1637
02:08:19,028 --> 02:08:21,644
A moment's business, my love.

1638
02:08:33,876 --> 02:08:35,161
Mahir, do you copy?

1639
02:08:35,336 --> 02:08:38,373
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!

1640
02:08:38,547 --> 02:08:39,547
Copy that.

1641
02:08:39,798 --> 02:08:42,915
I repeat, not clear!

1642
02:09:09,453 --> 02:09:10,533
Neil!

1643
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:12,410
Neil!

1644
02:09:25,302 --> 02:09:26,417
Go!

1645
02:09:35,354 --> 02:09:38,016
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

1646
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:45,982
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

1647
02:09:50,744 --> 02:09:51,744
Anything?

1648
02:09:51,912 --> 02:09:52,992
Nah, nothing.

1649
02:09:53,038 --> 02:09:55,078
Here, you try having a look.
Can you pick it?

1650
02:09:55,833 --> 02:09:57,039
I hope not.

1651
02:09:57,209 --> 02:09:59,040
I paid a lot for that lock.

1652
02:09:59,211 --> 02:10:01,953
How do you like where my journey began
and yours ends?

1653
02:10:02,131 --> 02:10:03,621
Little radioactive for my taste.

1654
02:10:03,799 --> 02:10:06,711
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

1655
02:10:07,928 --> 02:10:10,294
We'd work where no one else would.

1656
02:10:10,723 --> 02:10:13,180
I made a bargain with the devil.

1657
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:14,931
Money for time.

1658
02:10:15,102 --> 02:10:17,013
We sold our futures.

1659
02:10:17,187 --> 02:10:19,929
And now you're about to make
the same mistake for the entire world.

1660
02:10:20,607 --> 02:10:23,394
It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.

1661
02:10:23,569 --> 02:10:24,775
What was yours?

1662
02:10:24,945 --> 02:10:27,436
You fight for a cause
you barely understand...

1663
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:31,690
With people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.

1664
02:10:31,869 --> 02:10:33,951
When I die, the world dies with me.

1665
02:10:34,121 --> 02:10:36,203
And your knowledge dies with you,

1666
02:10:36,373 --> 02:10:39,865
buried in a tomb
like an anonymous egyptian builder

1667
02:10:40,044 --> 02:10:42,456
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.

1668
02:10:42,629 --> 02:10:45,041
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

1669
02:11:05,778 --> 02:11:08,340
What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?

1670
02:11:08,364 --> 02:11:10,776
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.

1671
02:11:11,367 --> 02:11:15,201
Somewhere, sometime, a man
in a crystalline tower throws a switch

1672
02:11:15,788 --> 02:11:19,372
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

1673
02:11:19,541 --> 02:11:22,908
Now time itself switches direction.

1674
02:11:23,087 --> 02:11:25,419
The same sunshine we basked in

1675
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:29,423
will warm the faces of our descendants
generations to come.

1676
02:11:29,593 --> 02:11:31,504
How could they wanna kill us?

1677
02:11:31,678 --> 02:11:34,841
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1678
02:11:35,015 --> 02:11:38,599
Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.

1679
02:11:39,228 --> 02:11:41,184
We're responsible.

1680
02:11:54,743 --> 02:11:57,234
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

1681
02:11:58,539 --> 02:11:59,619
Yes.

1682
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:02,326
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

1683
02:12:02,501 --> 02:12:04,332
That's exactly what they're doing.

1684
02:12:04,503 --> 02:12:06,664
But not you. You're a traitor.

1685
02:12:06,839 --> 02:12:09,751
Bringing death to all, because
you have no life of your own left.

1686
02:12:09,925 --> 02:12:11,631
When I'm done, life continues.

1687
02:12:11,802 --> 02:12:13,383
Not your son's.

1688
02:12:13,554 --> 02:12:17,172
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1689
02:12:17,349 --> 02:12:19,135
You think god will forgive me?

1690
02:12:24,982 --> 02:12:26,097
Wait!

1691
02:12:27,109 --> 02:12:28,109
Wait!

1692
02:12:29,153 --> 02:12:30,518
God...

1693
02:12:41,832 --> 02:12:43,368
Cover me!

1694
02:12:51,258 --> 02:12:53,089
Go! Go! Gol

1695
02:12:54,928 --> 02:12:57,544
You don't believe in god or a future,

1696
02:12:57,639 --> 02:12:59,675
or anything outside
of your own experience.

1697
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:02,262
The rest is belief.

1698
02:13:02,811 --> 02:13:04,767
And I don't have it.

1699
02:13:05,397 --> 02:13:07,308
Without it, you're not human.

1700
02:13:07,483 --> 02:13:08,893
You're just a madman.

1701
02:13:09,526 --> 02:13:11,517
Or a god.

1702
02:13:11,695 --> 02:13:12,525
Of sorts.

1703
02:13:12,696 --> 02:13:13,731
Like I said.

1704
02:13:16,992 --> 02:13:18,482
Don't. Jesus.

1705
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:20,325
Our time is up.

1706
02:13:27,085 --> 02:13:29,041
I'll give your love to my wife.

1707
02:13:29,713 --> 02:13:31,578
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

1708
02:13:32,132 --> 02:13:33,132
That's right.

1709
02:13:33,258 --> 02:13:34,873
After you meet her, she dies.

1710
02:13:35,052 --> 02:13:37,509
I'll just give her my love instead.

1711
02:13:38,805 --> 02:13:39,805
Don't do...

1712
02:13:41,266 --> 02:13:42,676
Volkov...

1713
02:13:56,198 --> 02:13:57,984
Enough business, my love.

1714
02:14:25,185 --> 02:14:27,801
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

1715
02:14:30,023 --> 02:14:32,605
But it sounds terribly important.

1716
02:14:34,736 --> 02:14:35,976
Where are you going?

1717
02:14:36,154 --> 02:14:37,394
Aren't you hot?

1718
02:14:54,131 --> 02:14:55,166
What are you doing now?

1719
02:14:55,674 --> 02:14:57,039
I spilled sunscreen.

1720
02:14:57,593 --> 02:14:59,424
- So what?
- Slippery!

1721
02:15:02,764 --> 02:15:04,174
Just come here.

1722
02:15:07,436 --> 02:15:08,436
Turn over.

1723
02:15:08,812 --> 02:15:10,177
You'll like it.

1724
02:15:44,723 --> 02:15:46,088
I can't do this.

1725
02:15:47,225 --> 02:15:49,662
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1726
02:15:49,686 --> 02:15:52,366
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1727
02:15:55,067 --> 02:15:56,523
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1728
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:57,879
Come on, come on, come on!

1729
02:15:57,903 --> 02:16:00,235
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.

1730
02:16:00,739 --> 02:16:02,229
Mahir, do you copy?

1731
02:16:02,699 --> 02:16:03,529
Yeah.

1732
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:05,531
Hold. I repeat, hold!

1733
02:16:10,874 --> 02:16:11,909
Look in my eyes.

1734
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:14,916
Which do you see?

1735
02:16:16,046 --> 02:16:18,958
Despair or anger?

1736
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:22,506
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

1737
02:16:22,594 --> 02:16:24,550
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

1738
02:16:26,348 --> 02:16:30,182
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1739
02:16:33,397 --> 02:16:34,397
No!

1740
02:16:53,583 --> 02:16:54,583
Shit.

1741
02:16:55,001 --> 02:16:57,681
Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.

1742
02:16:58,046 --> 02:17:00,788
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

1743
02:17:19,234 --> 02:17:21,771
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

1744
02:17:26,283 --> 02:17:27,443
Ah, screw it.

1745
02:18:38,146 --> 02:18:40,683
Kat! You jumped the gun!

1746
02:18:40,857 --> 02:18:42,518
I couldn't do it.

1747
02:18:42,692 --> 02:18:44,683
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

1748
02:18:44,903 --> 02:18:46,985
I knew you'd find a way.

1749
02:18:47,739 --> 02:18:49,570
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

1750
02:18:49,741 --> 02:18:51,857
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.

1751
02:19:13,598 --> 02:19:14,838
Thought you were inverted.

1752
02:19:15,225 --> 02:19:16,931
Changed gears halfway.

1753
02:19:18,436 --> 02:19:20,142
Looked like you needed help here.

1754
02:19:20,313 --> 02:19:22,429
Here? We needed help down there.

1755
02:19:23,733 --> 02:19:24,939
How'd you get that lock open?

1756
02:19:25,986 --> 02:19:28,068
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?

1757
02:19:29,155 --> 02:19:30,861
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1758
02:19:31,658 --> 02:19:32,658
All right, Ives?

1759
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:35,041
Once I've caught my breath.

1760
02:19:49,134 --> 02:19:51,500
No one who's seen this leaves the field.

1761
02:20:00,395 --> 02:20:01,885
All right.

1762
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:06,765
We hide it.

1763
02:20:07,652 --> 02:20:09,142
We end our lives.

1764
02:20:09,905 --> 02:20:12,112
That's the only way to be sure.

1765
02:20:13,867 --> 02:20:15,732
As to when...

1766
02:20:16,161 --> 02:20:18,527
Maybe that's every man's decision
to make for himself.

1767
02:20:19,664 --> 02:20:20,949
You're not gonna kill us?

1768
02:20:21,124 --> 02:20:23,490
If I ever find you, I will.

1769
02:20:23,668 --> 02:20:25,124
But you won't look too hard?

1770
02:20:26,171 --> 02:20:27,331
Yes, I will.

1771
02:20:31,134 --> 02:20:33,237
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

1772
02:20:33,261 --> 02:20:34,091
No.

1773
02:20:34,262 --> 02:20:35,798
It's far too dangerous.

1774
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:38,221
Even from afar?

1775
02:20:39,476 --> 02:20:40,886
Even from afar.

1776
02:20:43,188 --> 02:20:44,348
Ives!

1777
02:20:45,357 --> 02:20:46,597
Wait.

1778
02:20:52,948 --> 02:20:54,438
Are you really going back in?

1779
02:20:57,327 --> 02:21:00,160
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

1780
02:21:00,538 --> 02:21:02,995
Well, I don't know any locksmiths
as good as you.

1781
02:21:04,459 --> 02:21:05,539
See?

1782
02:21:06,294 --> 02:21:08,125
It's me in there, again.

1783
02:21:08,755 --> 02:21:11,667
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

1784
02:21:20,266 --> 02:21:21,266
Neil, wait!

1785
02:21:25,647 --> 02:21:27,262
Just saved the world.

1786
02:21:27,774 --> 02:21:29,639
Can't leave anything to chance.

1787
02:21:30,235 --> 02:21:32,476
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

1788
02:21:33,154 --> 02:21:35,361
"What has happened has happened.”

1789
02:21:35,532 --> 02:21:38,524
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1790
02:21:39,202 --> 02:21:40,738
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1791
02:21:41,329 --> 02:21:42,159
Fate?

1792
02:21:42,330 --> 02:21:43,661
Call it what you want.

1793
02:21:44,124 --> 02:21:45,124
What do you call it?

1794
02:21:46,001 --> 02:21:47,116
Reality.

1795
02:21:49,796 --> 02:21:51,081
Now let me go.

1796
02:21:56,803 --> 02:21:59,340
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1797
02:21:59,514 --> 02:22:01,220
Haven't you guessed by now?

1798
02:22:02,225 --> 02:22:03,225
You did.

1799
02:22:03,935 --> 02:22:06,472
Only not when you thought.

1800
02:22:06,646 --> 02:22:08,978
You have a future in the past.

1801
02:22:09,149 --> 02:22:12,107
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

1802
02:22:13,153 --> 02:22:14,563
You've known me for years?

1803
02:22:16,406 --> 02:22:20,194
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1804
02:22:20,368 --> 02:22:22,154
But for me, it's just the beginning.

1805
02:22:22,871 --> 02:22:24,782
We get up to some stuff.

1806
02:22:25,206 --> 02:22:27,663
You're gonna love it. You'll see.

1807
02:22:28,543 --> 02:22:30,784
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

1808
02:22:31,379 --> 02:22:32,619
Whose?

1809
02:22:34,090 --> 02:22:35,090
Yours!

1810
02:22:35,884 --> 02:22:37,420
You're only halfway there.

1811
02:22:37,594 --> 02:22:39,380
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

1812
02:22:48,188 --> 02:22:51,351
We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

1813
02:22:51,524 --> 02:22:53,284
World will never know
what could've happened.

1814
02:22:55,278 --> 02:22:58,065
And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.

1815
02:23:02,368 --> 02:23:04,609
Because no one cares
about the bomb that didn't go off.

1816
02:23:06,164 --> 02:23:07,370
Only the one that did.

1817
02:23:10,001 --> 02:23:11,241
Do it before the boy comes out.

1818
02:23:14,089 --> 02:23:17,126
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1819
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:20,337
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

1820
02:23:20,845 --> 02:23:22,710
Here, today.

1821
02:23:24,099 --> 02:23:25,589
How did you know?

1822
02:23:27,727 --> 02:23:30,309
Cannon place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1823
02:23:30,814 --> 02:23:31,644
Posterity.

1824
02:23:31,815 --> 02:23:35,273
Cannon place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1825
02:23:36,111 --> 02:23:39,023
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1826
02:23:39,906 --> 02:23:42,739
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1827
02:23:42,826 --> 02:23:43,986
Then whose was it?

1828
02:23:44,077 --> 02:23:45,487
Mine.

1829
02:23:45,662 --> 02:23:48,745
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1830
02:23:49,457 --> 02:23:51,288
I'm the protagonist.

1831
02:23:53,837 --> 02:23:55,828
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

1832
02:23:59,717 --> 02:24:01,127
Mission accomplished.

1833
02:24:03,221 --> 02:24:04,821
It's the bomb that didn't go off.

1834
02:24:05,598 --> 02:24:08,055
The danger no one knew was real.

1835
02:24:13,606 --> 02:24:16,439
That's the bomb
with the real power to change the world.
